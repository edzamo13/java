Function

consumer, predicate and Supplier

Predicate take something check conditional and that's why it is bound to return a boolean.

Consumer does not return anything.

Supplier only supplies it does not take anything but most of the time

we need to have input argument and return value both, so function is the functional interfaces that can
take something


summary:

Predicate =  To test a condition
Consumer = To consume something and return back nothing
Function= to accept something and return back something
Supplier accepts nothing but return something
